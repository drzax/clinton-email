# Downloader for Hilary Clinton email foia

Usage:

Clone this repo.

```
cd clinton-email
npm i
./index.js
```

This could easily be generalised to work with all US State Department FOI<br>reading room document searches.

This will just get you the data. I highly recommend looking into [WSJ's Clinton email cruncher](https://github.com/wsjdata/clinton-email-cruncher) if you're doing any serious analysis.

Good luck!
